Welcome to Canvas: a project from FHSCS 2020-2021

This project is meant to focus on how animation, time, and moving visuals are manipulated within a simplified context.
I chose to work with Java GUI to demonstrate the generation of geometric shapes with Robert Penner's easing functions: https://github.com/jesusgollonet/processing-penner-easing/tree/master/src

TODO: 
Add threads for shape generation efficiency
Dark Mode
Option for shape collision (generation stops when it hits another object)
Position offset
Clean Object Creation
	
Known Bugs:
Shapes disappearing on generation
